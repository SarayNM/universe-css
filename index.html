    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Universe, the whole cosmic system of matter and energy of which Earth, and therefore the human race, is a part. Humanity has traveled a long road since societies imagined Earth, the Sun, and the Moon as the main objects of creation, with the rest of the universe being formed almost as an afterthought. Today it is known that Earth is only a small ball of rock in a space of unimaginable vastness and that the birth of the solar system was probably only one event among many that occurred against the backdrop of an already mature universe. This humbling lesson has unveiled a remarkable fact, one that endows the minutest particle in the universe with a rich and noble heritage: events that occurred in the first few minutes of the creation of the universe 13.7 billion years ago turn out to have had a profound influence on the birth, life, and death of galaxies, stars, and planets. Indeed, a line can be drawn from the forging of the matter of the universe in a primal “big bang” to the gathering on Earth of atoms versatile enough to serve as the basis of life. The intrinsic harmony of such a worldview has great philosophical and aesthetic appeal, and it may explain why public interest in the universe has always endured.</p>
    <h3>Earliest conceptions of the universe</h3>
    <p>All scientific thinking on the nature of the universe can be traced to the distinctive geometric patterns formed by the stars in the night sky. Even prehistoric people must have noticed that, apart from a daily rotation (which is now understood to arise from the spin of Earth), the stars did not seem to move with respect to one another: the stars appear “fixed.” Early nomads found that knowledge of the constellations could guide their travels, and they developed stories to help them remember the relative positions of the stars in the night sky. These stories became the mythical tales that are part of most cultures.</p>

    <h3>Astronomical theories of the ancient Greeks</h3>
    <p>The apex in the description of planetary motions during classical antiquity was reached with the Greeks, who were of course superb geometers. Like their predecessors, Greek astronomers adopted the natural picture, from the point of view of an observer on Earth, that Earth lay motionless at the centre of a rigidly rotating celestial sphere (to which the stars were “fixed”), and that the complex to-and-fro wanderings of the planets in the zodiac were to be described against this unchanging backdrop. They developed an epicyclic model that would reproduce the observed planetary motions with quite astonishing accuracy. The model invoked small circles on top of large circles, all rotating at individual uniform speeds, and it culminated about 140 CE with the work of Ptolemy, who introduced the ingenious artifact of displaced centres for the circles to improve the empirical fit. Although the model was purely kinematic and did not attempt to address the dynamical reasons for why the motions were as they were, it laid the groundwork for the paradigm that nature is not capricious but possesses a regularity and precision that can be discovered from experience and used to predict future events.</p>

    <h3>The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward is the following:</h3>
<ol class="red">
    <li>Mercury</li>
    <li>Venus</li>
    <li>Earth</li>
    <li>Mars</li>
    <li>Jupiter</li>
    <li>Saturn</li>
    <li>Uranus</li>
    <li>Neptune</li>
</ol>

<h3>ASSEMBLING YOUR TELESCOPE</h3>

<p>This guide assumes you have put your telescope together according to the manufacturer’s directions. Here are a few hints to make that job easier:</p>

<ul class="pink">
    <li>Put your telescope together for the first time when you are indoors and have lots of light. Just because a telescope is normally used during evening hours doesn’t mean you have to set it up in the dark!</li>
    <li>Give yourself plenty of room, and gather together a good portion of patience, as well as any tools that are required for assembly before you start.</li>
    <li>Once you are finished with assembly, stay indoors and take some time to learn a bit more about its features before you take your telescope outside for the first time.</li>
</ul>
